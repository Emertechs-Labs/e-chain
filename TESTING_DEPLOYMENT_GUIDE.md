# Echain Smart Contract Testing & Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Comprehensive Testing (COMPLETED)

### Basic Functionality Tests
```bash
cd blockchain
npm test
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ All 17 tests passing

### Test Results Summary:
- ‚úÖ Contract deployment and initialization
- ‚úÖ Access control and permissions
- ‚úÖ Event creation and management
- ‚úÖ Organizer verification system
- ‚úÖ Input validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Pagination and data retrieval

## üöÄ Phase 2: Testnet Deployment

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] **Configure environment variables**
- [ ] **Obtain testnet ETH**
- [ ] **Set up MultiBaas account (if using)**
- [ ] **Configure treasury address**

### Step 1: Environment Setup

1. **Copy deployment configuration:**
```bash
cd blockchain
cp deployment-config.template.js deployment-config.development.js
```

2. **Edit configuration with your details:**
```javascript
// deployment-config.development.js
const deploymentConfig = {
  deployerPrivateKey: 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
  deploymentEndpoint: 'YOUR_MULTIBAAS_ENDPOINT',
  web3Key: 'YOUR_WEB3_API_KEY',
  adminApiKey: 'YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY',
  // OR use direct RPC
  rpcUrl: 'https://your-testnet-rpc.com'
};
```

3. **Set environment variables:**
```bash
export TREASURY_ADDRESS="0x..." # Your treasury address
export MULTISIG_ADDRESS="0x..." # Your multisig address (for future use)
export NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Deploy using secure deployment script
npm run deploy:events:dev

# Or use the enhanced secure deployment
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-secure.ts --network development
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

The deployment script will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Deploy all contracts
- ‚úÖ Configure contract relationships
- ‚úÖ Run security checks
- ‚úÖ Create test event
- ‚úÖ Generate monitoring script
- ‚úÖ Save deployment addresses

### Step 4: Manual Verification

```bash
# Check contract verification on block explorer
# Verify all addresses are correct
# Test basic functions manually
```

## üîç Phase 3: Post-Deployment Validation

### Functional Testing Checklist

1. **Event Factory Tests**
   - [ ] Create event (as verified organizer)
   - [ ] Update event metadata
   - [ ] Toggle event status
   - [ ] Query active events with pagination

2. **Event Ticket Tests**
   - [ ] Mint single ticket with payment
   - [ ] Batch mint tickets
   - [ ] Transfer tickets (unrestricted)
   - [ ] Attempt restricted transfer
   - [ ] Use tickets for entry
   - [ ] Withdraw funds (organizer only)

3. **Access Control Tests**
   - [ ] Verify only owner can add/remove organizers
   - [ ] Test pause/unpause functionality
   - [ ] Verify emergency functions work

4. **POAP Tests**
   - [ ] Mint attendance POAP with valid signature
   - [ ] Verify soulbound functionality (cannot transfer)
   - [ ] Test nonce mechanism prevents replay

5. **Incentive Tests**
   - [ ] Claim early bird reward
   - [ ] Generate and use referral codes
   - [ ] Update loyalty points

### Security Validation

```bash
# Run the monitoring script
cd monitoring
node monitor.js

# Check for any unexpected events or state changes
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Phase 4: Security & Monitoring Setup

### 1. Multi-Signature Wallet Setup

**For Production Only - DO NOT DO ON TESTNET**

```bash
# Transfer ownership to multisig (ONLY for mainnet)
# This is IRREVERSIBLE - only do after thorough testing

# Example commands (DO NOT RUN ON TESTNET):
# eventFactory.transferOwnership(MULTISIG_ADDRESS)
# poapAttendance.transferOwnership(MULTISIG_ADDRESS)  
# incentiveManager.transferOwnership(MULTISIG_ADDRESS)
```

### 2. Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Set up automated monitoring
cd monitoring
npm install ethers

# Configure monitoring script with your RPC endpoint
export RPC_URL="your-rpc-endpoint"

# Set up cron job to run monitoring every 5 minutes
crontab -e
# Add: */5 * * * * cd /path/to/project/monitoring && node monitor.js >> monitor.log 2>&1
```

### 3. Emergency Procedures

Create emergency response procedures:

```javascript
// Emergency pause (owner only)
await eventFactory.pause();
await incentiveManager.pause();

// Emergency deactivate event
await eventFactory.emergencyDeactivateEvent(eventId);
```

## üìä Phase 5: Performance & Gas Optimization

### Gas Usage Analysis

Expected gas costs (approximate):
- EventFactory deployment: ~3,500,000 gas
- EventTicket template: ~2,800,000 gas
- Event creation: ~200,000 gas
- Ticket minting: ~80,000 gas
- Batch minting (10): ~400,000 gas

### Optimization Recommendations

1. **Batch Operations**: Use batch minting for multiple tickets
2. **Event Pagination**: Limit pagination queries to avoid gas limit issues
3. **IPFS Metadata**: Store large metadata off-chain
4. **Event Archival**: Consider archiving old events

## üåê Phase 6: Frontend Integration

### Environment Variables

Update your frontend `.env` file:

```bash
# Contract Addresses (from deployment output)
NEXT_PUBLIC_EVENT_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_EVENT_TICKET_TEMPLATE_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_POAP_ATTENDANCE_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_INCENTIVE_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x...

# Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111 # Sepolia testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-key
```

### Integration Testing

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev

# Test frontend integration:
# 1. Connect wallet
# 2. Create event
# 3. Purchase ticket
# 4. Verify all functions work
```

## üöÄ Phase 7: Mainnet Deployment Strategy

### Gradual Rollout Plan

1. **Alpha Release** (Limited Users)
   - Deploy to mainnet
   - Enable only verified organizers
   - Monitor for 1 week
   - Limit max tickets per event

2. **Beta Release** (Expanded Access)
   - Increase organizer limits
   - Enable public organizer registration
   - Add more event types
   - Monitor performance

3. **Full Release**
   - Remove all artificial limits
   - Enable all features
   - Launch marketing campaign

### Pre-Mainnet Checklist

- [ ] **Complete testnet testing**
- [ ] **External security audit**
- [ ] **Multi-signature setup**
- [ ] **Emergency procedures documented**
- [ ] **Monitoring systems active**
- [ ] **Team trained on incident response**
- [ ] **Legal compliance review**
- [ ] **Insurance coverage**

## üìû Emergency Contacts

### Incident Response Team
- **Technical Lead**: [Contact Info]
- **Security Lead**: [Contact Info]  
- **DevOps Lead**: [Contact Info]
- **Legal Contact**: [Contact Info]

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Pause all contracts immediately**
2. **Notify incident response team**
3. **Assess impact and scope**
4. **Implement fix if available**
5. **Communicate with users**
6. **Post-incident review**
