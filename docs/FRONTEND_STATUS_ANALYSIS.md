## 🔍 Current Status Overview

### ✅ Working Components

1. **Contract Wrapper System** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: Was converting event ticket contract addresses to template contract name
   - **Fix Applied**: Now passes `contractNameOrAddress` directly without conversion
   - **File**: `lib/contract-wrapper.ts`
   - **Status**: Deployed to production

2. **BigInt Serialization** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: Console logging causing crashes with BigInt values
   - **Fix Applied**: Added `safeStringifyArgs` helper and `String()` conversion
   - **File**: `lib/contract-fallback.ts`, `app/hooks/useTickets.ts`
   - **Status**: Deployed to production

3. **API Route Validation** - ENHANCED ✅
   - **Issue**: Missing validation for contract addresses
   - **Fix Applied**: Added parameter validation and format checking
   - **File**: `app/api/contracts/user-tickets/route.ts`
   - **Status**: Deployed to production

4. **Enhanced Logging** - COMPLETE ✅
   - **Issue**: Insufficient debugging information
   - **Fix Applied**: Added comprehensive logging throughout data flow
   - **Files**: Multiple hooks and API routes
   - **Status**: Deployed to production

5. **Event Discovery System** - WORKING ✅
   - **Method 1**: Blockchain direct query (most accurate)
   - **Method 2**: LocalStorage cache (fallback)
   - **Method 3**: Database API (future)
   - **File**: `app/hooks/useEvents.ts`
   - **Status**: Multi-tier strategy implemented

### ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **ESLint CSS Warning** - Minor Issue ⚠️
   - **Location**: `app/my-events/page.tsx:141`
   - **Issue**: "CSS inline styles should not be used"
   - **Justification**: Inline styles are REQUIRED for dynamic data-driven progress bar animations
   - **Impact**: None (warning only, not a runtime error)
   - **Comment Added**: `// Dynamic width for progress bar - inline styles required for data-driven animations`

2. **Production Testing Not Verified** - Critical Gap ⚠️
   - **Issue**: Real transaction testing not completed in production
   - **Impact**: Can't confirm if ticket purchase → detection → display workflow works end-to-end
   - **Required**: Manual testing with real wallet transactions on Base Sepolia

3. **EventCard Component Location** - Organization Issue ⚠️
   - **Location**: `app/components/events/EventCard.tsx` (should be in `components/events/`)
   - **Impact**: Minor organizational inconsistency
   - **Fix**: Move to proper `components/` directory structure

### ❓ Uncertain/Needs Testing

1. **Ticket Display on My-Tickets Page**
   - **Depends On**: Contract wrapper fix
   - **Test Required**: Purchase ticket → Check my-tickets page
   - **Expected**: Tickets should now appear after purchase
   - **Status**: NEEDS REAL TRANSACTION TEST

2. **"You Already Have a Ticket" Detection**
   - **Depends On**: Contract balance check with correct address
   - **Test Required**: Purchase ticket → Try purchasing again
   - **Expected**: Should detect existing ticket and show message
   - **Status**: NEEDS REAL TRANSACTION TEST

3. **IPFS Metadata Loading**
   - **System**: Pinata with multiple gateway fallback
   - **Test Required**: Verify images/descriptions load on event cards
   - **Expected**: Metadata should load from IPFS with caching
   - **Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION

4. **Event Creation Flow**
   - **Recent Changes**: ABI regeneration, contract wrapper fixes
   - **Test Required**: Create new event → Verify it appears in events list
   - **Expected**: Event should be created and discoverable
   - **Status**: NEEDS TESTING

5. **POAP Claiming**
   - **System**: Attendance-based POAP minting
   - **Test Required**: Attend event (time-based) → Claim POAP
   - **Expected**: POAP should be claimable after event start
   - **Status**: NEEDS TESTING

6. **Rewards Dashboard**
   - **System**: Loyalty points and referral rewards
   - **Test Required**: Check if metrics display correctly
   - **Expected**: Should show loyalty points, referrals, etc.
   - **Status**: NEEDS TESTING

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Fetching Strategy

```
Priority 1: Blockchain Direct Query
├─ readContract(EventFactory, 'eventCount')
├─ readContract(EventFactory, 'events', [eventId])
└─ Most Accurate, Source of Truth

Priority 2: LocalStorage Cache
├─ storeEventFromTransaction()
├─ getCachedEvents()
└─ Fast, Offline-capable

Priority 3: Database API (Future)
├─ GET /api/events
└─ Webhook-based (to be implemented)
```

### Contract Address Flow

```
Old Flow (BROKEN):
User purchases ticket for Event #1
└─ Event #1 has ticketContract: 0x22bAc...
   └─ contract-wrapper receives: 0x22bAc...
      └─ converts to contractName: "EventTicket" (WRONG)
         └─ directContractRead uses template address: 0xc8cd3...
            └─ balanceOf returns 0 (checking wrong contract!)

New Flow (FIXED):
User purchases ticket for Event #1
└─ Event #1 has ticketContract: 0x22bAc...
   └─ contract-wrapper receives: 0x22bAc...
      └─ passes directly as: 0x22bAc... (CORRECT)
         └─ directContractRead uses actual address: 0x22bAc...
            └─ balanceOf returns correct balance
```

### Factory Pattern (Critical Understanding)

```
EventFactory Contract
├─ Creates unique ticket contract per event
├─ Event #1 → TicketContract @ 0x22bAc... (UNIQUE)
├─ Event #2 → TicketContract @ 0x33cBd... (UNIQUE)
├─ Event #3 → TicketContract @ 0x44dCe... (UNIQUE)
└─ Template @ 0xc8cd3... (NEVER USED FOR USER TICKETS)

Key Insight: Each event has its OWN ticket contract address
```

## 📝 Testing Checklist

### Critical Path Testing

- [ ] **1. Event Discovery**
  - [ ] Navigate to /events
  - [ ] Verify events load from blockchain
  - [ ] Check console for discovery logs
  - [ ] Verify metadata (images, descriptions) loads

- [ ] **2. Event Creation**
  - [ ] Navigate to /events/create
  - [ ] Fill out event form
  - [ ] Submit transaction
  - [ ] Verify event appears in /my-events
  - [ ] Check event details page /events/[id]

- [ ] **3. Ticket Purchase Flow**

  - [ ] Try to purchase same event again
  - [ ] **VERIFY "You already have a ticket" message** ← Critical Test

- [ ] **5. POAP Claiming**

## 🐛 Debugging Guide

### If Events Don't Load

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   ```
   [useEvents] Starting transaction-based event discovery...
   [useEvents] Attempting blockchain event discovery...
   [useEvents] Found X events on blockchain
   ```

2. **Verify Contract Connection**:
   - Look for contract read errors
   - Confirm direct RPC fallback activates if primary request fails
   - Verify network is Base Sepolia (84532)

3. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for failed API calls
   - Verify RPC endpoint responds
   - Check for CORS issues

### If Tickets Don't Appear in My-Tickets

1. **Check Purchase Confirmation**:
   - Transaction hash should be logged
   - Look for `[storeTicketFromTransaction]` log
   - Verify localStorage has entry

2. **Check Contract Balance Call**:
   ```
   [getTicketsFromContractBalances] Checking balance for contract: 0x...
   [getTicketsFromContractBalances] User ... has balance: X
   ```

3. **Verify Correct Address Used**:
   - Contract address should be event-specific (NOT 0xc8cd3...)
   - Check console for address being queried
   - Confirm address matches event's ticketContract

### If "Already Have Ticket" Doesn't Work

1. **Check Balance Query**:
   - Should see balance check in console
   - Verify correct contract address used
   - Check if balance > 0

2. **Check LocalStorage**:
   - Open DevTools → Application → LocalStorage
   - Look for `ticket_purchases_` key
   - Verify transaction exists for event
