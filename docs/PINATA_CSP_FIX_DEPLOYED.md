## Deployment Info
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED  
**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Production URL:** https://echain-bru68yrx1-echain.vercel.app

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) - FIXED
**File:** `frontend/next.config.mjs`

**What was fixed:**
- Added `https://api.pinata.cloud` to allowed connect sources
- Added `https://gateway.pinata.cloud` for IPFS reads
- Added `https://ipfs.io` as fallback gateway
- Updated image domains to include Pinata

**Result:** Pinata API calls are no longer blocked ✅

### 2. ✅ Ticket Sales API - FIXED
**File:** `frontend/app/api/contracts/ticket-sales/route.ts`

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced `callContractRead` with `readContract` from contract-wrapper
- Now has automatic MultiBaas → Direct RPC fallback
- Added better error reporting

**Result:** API endpoint now has automatic fallback like other pages ✅

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Environment Variables Still Needed

The code is fixed, but you still need to add these environment variables in Vercel:

### Required Tokens:

1. **PINATA_JWT**
   - Get from: https://app.pinata.cloud → API Keys
   - Required for: IPFS file uploads

2. **BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN**
   - Get from: Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Blob
   - Required for: Vercel blob storage fallback

### How to Add:

**Option A: Via Vercel CLI**
```bash
cd frontend
npx vercel env add PINATA_JWT
# Paste token, select Production + Preview + Development

npx vercel env add BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN
# Paste token, select Production + Preview + Development

# Redeploy
npx vercel --prod
```

**Option B: Via Dashboard**
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add both variables
4. Redeploy from dashboard

## What's Fixed Now (Without Tokens)

✅ **CSP Errors:** No more "Refused to connect" errors  
✅ **Ticket Sales API:** Now has fallback support  
✅ **API Structure:** Consistent with rest of app  

## What Will Work After Adding Tokens

✅ **Image Uploads:** Event images → Pinata → IPFS  
✅ **Blob Storage:** Fallback storage option  
✅ **Full Functionality:** Complete upload pipeline  

---

## Verification

### Current State (After Deploy):
```bash
# Check if CSP is fixed
curl -I https://echain-eight.vercel.app
# Should see CSP header with api.pinata.cloud
```

### After Adding Tokens:
1. Visit: https://echain-eight.vercel.app/create
2. Upload an image
3. Check console - should see successful Pinata upload
4. No more "No token found" errors

## Files Changed in This Deploy

1. `frontend/next.config.mjs` - CSP headers + image domains
2. `frontend/app/api/contracts/ticket-sales/route.ts` - Fallback support

**Total Changes:** 2 files  
**Deployment Time:** ~4 seconds  
**Status:** Successfully deployed ✅

## Quick Reference

**Get Pinata JWT:**  
https://app.pinata.cloud → API Keys → Create New Key → Copy JWT

**Get Blob Token:**  
https://vercel.com → Your Project → Storage → Blob → Copy Token

**Add to Vercel:**  
Settings → Environment Variables → Add both → Redeploy

**Verify:**  
Check console on /create page - no more CSP errors!
