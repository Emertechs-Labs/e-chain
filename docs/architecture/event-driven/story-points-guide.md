## üéØ Estimation Process

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Story Preparation (5 minutes)
- **Product Owner** reads the user story clearly
- **Team** asks clarifying questions about requirements
- **Acceptance criteria** reviewed and confirmed
- **Assumptions** identified and documented

#### 2. Individual Estimation (3 minutes)
- Each team member selects a card privately
- No discussion during this phase
- Consider complexity, effort, and risk factors

#### 3. Card Reveal & Discussion (5-10 minutes)
- All cards revealed simultaneously
- Discuss differences in estimates
- Identify assumptions and concerns
- Re-estimate if needed

#### 4. Consensus & Commitment (2 minutes)
- Team agrees on final estimate
- Story points recorded in backlog
- Move to next story

### Estimation Factors

#### Complexity Factors
- **Technical Complexity**: New technologies, algorithms, integrations
- **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding of business rules and requirements
- **Dependencies**: External systems, third-party APIs, team coordination

#### Effort Factors
- **Development Time**: Actual coding, testing, debugging
- **Research Time**: Learning new technologies or approaches
- **Documentation**: Code comments, user guides, API documentation

#### Risk Factors
- **Uncertainty**: Unknown requirements or technical challenges
- **Dependencies**: Reliance on other teams or external services
- **Testing Complexity**: Difficult-to-test scenarios or edge cases

## üìã Story Point Scale

### Fibonacci Sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

| Points | Description | Time Estimate | Complexity Level | Example Tasks |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| **1** | Trivial | <2 hours | Very Simple | Configuration change, simple bug fix |
| **2** | Small | 2-4 hours | Simple | Single component, basic feature |
| **3** | Medium | 4-8 hours | Moderate | Feature with tests, API integration |
| **5** | Large | 1-2 days | Complex | Multi-component feature, complex logic |
| **8** | Extra Large | 2-3 days | Very Complex | Major feature, multiple integrations |
| **13** | Epic | 3-5 days | Extremely Complex | System overhaul, architectural change |

### When to Split Stories

#### Split Criteria
- **Too Large**: If estimate > 8 points, consider splitting
- **Multiple Concerns**: Different types of work (UI + API + DB)
- **Independent Parts**: Can be developed and tested separately
- **Different Owners**: Requires different team members or skills

#### Splitting Techniques
- **Vertical Slices**: Complete features end-to-end
- **Horizontal Slices**: Divide by layer (frontend, backend, database)
- **Workflow Steps**: Break into user journey steps
- **Technical Boundaries**: Separate concerns by technology or system

## üé≤ Planning Poker Rules

### Basic Rules

#### 1. No Discussion During Estimation
- Each person estimates independently
- No influencing others' estimates
- Cards revealed simultaneously

#### 2. Explain Your Estimate
- When estimates differ, explain your reasoning
- Share assumptions and concerns
- Focus on facts, not opinions

#### 3. Seek Consensus
- Discuss until team agrees
- Re-estimate if needed
- No voting - find agreement

#### 4. Use Reference Stories
- Compare to previously completed stories
- "This is similar to the login feature (5 points)"
- Build estimation history

### Advanced Rules

#### 1. Three Choices on Reveal
- **Agreement**: All estimates within 1 point ‚Üí Accept highest
- **Discussion**: Estimates vary ‚Üí Discuss differences
- **Re-estimate**: Major disagreement ‚Üí Re-estimate privately

#### 2. Breaking Ties
- Product Owner has final say on disagreements
- Consider team experience and expertise
- Document reasoning for future reference

#### 3. Time Boxing
- 15 minutes maximum per story
- If no consensus, Product Owner decides
- Can revisit during sprint planning

## üìà Estimation Examples

### Event-Driven Architecture Stories

#### Example 1: WebSocket Server Setup (3 points)
```
User Story: Set up WebSocket server with Socket.io

Breakdown:
- Install dependencies: 30 min
- Basic server configuration: 1 hour
- Connection handling: 1 hour
- Error handling: 30 min
- Testing: 1 hour
- Documentation: 30 min

Total: ~4.5 hours ‚Üí 3 points (fits in one day)
```

#### Example 2: Coinbase Webhook Integration (5 points)
```
User Story: Implement Coinbase webhook processing with signature verification

Breakdown:
- API endpoint creation: 1 hour
- Signature verification logic: 2 hours
- Event processing pipeline: 2 hours
- Error handling: 1 hour
- Testing with mock data: 2 hours
- Integration testing: 2 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour

Total: ~11 hours ‚Üí 5 points (complex integration)
```

#### Example 3: The Graph Subgraph Deployment (8 points)
```
User Story: Deploy and configure The Graph subgraph for event indexing

Breakdown:
- Schema design and analysis: 4 hours
- Subgraph configuration: 2 hours
- Event handler implementation: 6 hours
- Testing and debugging: 4 hours
- Deployment to Studio: 2 hours
- Sync verification: 2 hours
- Documentation and monitoring: 2 hours

Total: ~22 hours ‚Üí 8 points (major integration, high complexity)
```

#### Example 4: Real-Time UI Updates (3 points)
```
User Story: Add real-time updates to event details page

Breakdown:
- WebSocket hook integration: 1 hour
- UI state management: 1 hour
- Error handling: 30 min
- Testing: 1 hour
- Cross-browser testing: 30 min

Total: ~4 hours ‚Üí 3 points (UI integration)
```

### Common Estimation Mistakes

#### 1. Underestimating Integration
```
‚ùå "Just add a button" (1 point)
‚úÖ "Add button with API call, error handling, and testing" (3 points)
```

#### 2. Forgetting Testing Time
```
‚ùå "Implement feature" (3 points)
‚úÖ "Implement feature with unit tests, integration tests" (5 points)
```

#### 3. Ignoring Dependencies
```
‚ùå "Build API endpoint" (2 points)
‚úÖ "Build API endpoint (waiting for database schema)" (5 points)
```

#### 4. Not Considering Edge Cases
```
‚ùå "Handle user login" (3 points)
‚úÖ "Handle user login with validation, errors, security" (5 points)
```

## üìä Velocity and Capacity Planning

### Calculating Team Velocity

#### Formula
```
Average Velocity = Total Story Points Completed √∑ Number of Sprints
Target Velocity = Team Size √ó 4-6 points per person per sprint
```

#### Example Calculation
```
Team Size: 5 developers
Sprint Length: 2 weeks
Individual Capacity: 5 points per sprint
Team Velocity: 5 √ó 5 = 25 points per sprint

Adjusted for:
- Meetings: -10% = 22.5
- Support/Bugs: -15% = 21.25
- Realistic Velocity: 20-22 points per sprint
```

### Sprint Capacity Factors

#### Positive Factors (+)
- Team experience with technology
- Well-refined backlog
- Good development environment
- Minimal interruptions

#### Negative Factors (-)
- Team member vacations
- High priority bugs
- Complex integrations
- Learning new technologies

#### Capacity Calculation
```
Base Capacity = Team Size √ó Points per Person √ó Sprint Days
Adjusted Capacity = Base Capacity √ó (1 + Positive Factors - Negative Factors)
```

## üéØ Estimation Calibration

### Sprint 1 Baseline Stories

#### Anchor Stories (Known Complexity)
- **1 point**: Add environment variable validation
- **2 points**: Configure Redis connection
- **3 points**: Set up WebSocket server
- **5 points**: Implement Coinbase webhook endpoint

#### Sprint 1 Velocity Goal
```
Target: 15 points
Breakdown:
- 3 stories √ó 3 points = 9 points (60%)
- 2 stories √ó 2 points = 4 points (27%)
- 1 story √ó 1 point = 1 point (7%)
- Buffer for unexpected work = 1 point (6%)
```

### Calibration Process

#### After Sprint 1
1. **Calculate Actual Velocity**: Points completed √∑ Planned points
2. **Identify Estimation Bias**: Over/under estimation patterns
3. **Adjust Future Estimates**: Calibrate based on actual effort
4. **Update Baseline Stories**: Add completed stories as references

#### Example Calibration
```
Sprint 1 Results:
- Planned: 15 points
- Completed: 14 points
- Velocity: 14/15 = 93% efficiency

Lessons:
- Webhook integration took longer than expected (+1 point)
- Redis setup was faster than expected (-0.5 points)
- Adjust similar stories accordingly
```

```

### For Features (4-16 hours)
```
Points: 3-5
Check: Requires testing and documentation?
Yes ‚Üí Add 1 point | No ‚Üí Base estimate
```

### For Complex Work (1-3 days)
```
