## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Event-Driven Data Flow

```typescript
// Event capture → Processing → Broadcasting → UI Update
interface EventFlow {
  capture: (webhook: WebhookEvent) => Promise<void>;
  process: (event: ProcessedEvent) => Promise<void>;
  broadcast: (update: RealtimeUpdate) => Promise<void>;
  cache: (data: CachedData) => Promise<void>;
}
```

#### 2. Multi-Source Data Access

```typescript
// Unified data access with fallback strategy
class DataAccessLayer {
  async getEvent(eventId: string): Promise<EventData> {
    // Try cache first
    const cached = await this.cache.get(`event:${eventId}`);
    if (cached) return cached;

    // Try Graph → Covalent → Chainstack → RPC fallback
    try {
      return await this.graph.getEvent(eventId);
    } catch {
      try {
        return await this.covalent.getEvent(eventId);
      } catch {
        return await this.chainstack.getEvent(eventId);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Real-Time WebSocket Management

```typescript
// Room-based broadcasting with authentication
class WebSocketManager {
  private io: Server;

  joinEventRoom(socket: Socket, eventId: string) {
    socket.join(`event:${eventId}`);
  }

  broadcastEventUpdate(eventId: string, update: EventUpdate) {
    this.io.to(`event:${eventId}`).emit('event-update', update);
  }
}
```
