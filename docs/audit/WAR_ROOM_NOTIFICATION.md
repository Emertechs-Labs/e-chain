## 📋 **Why This Meeting Matters**

Our current beta readiness stands at **70/100** with critical blockers remaining:

- **Security Issues**: Treasury governance and payout mechanisms (Medium Risk)
- **API Infrastructure**: Missing cache layer causing direct RPC dependency (High Impact)
- **Testing Gaps**: No E2E testing suite for user flows (Medium Impact)
- **UX Issues**: Accessibility and CTA hierarchy gaps (Medium Impact)

**Target Beta Launch:** December 22, 2025 (27 days from war room)
