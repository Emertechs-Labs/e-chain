# Echain Bridge Documentation

This directory contains documentation for Echain's custom cross-chain bridge architecture, enabling multi-blockchain support while maintaining core contracts on Base.

## Overview

Echain's bridge system provides universal blockchain interoperability through a modular adapter architecture. This allows users to interact with Echain from any supported blockchain without redeploying smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Modular Adapters**: Easy integration of new blockchains
- **Message-Based Communication**: Standardized cross-chain messaging
- **Asset Bridging**: Support for native and wrapped tokens
- **Security-First**: Multi-sig controls and regular audits

## Documentation Structure

### [Architecture](./architecture.md)
Comprehensive guide to the bridge system architecture, including:
- Core components and layers
- Message protocols
- Security model
- Implementation roadmap

### [Adapters](./adapters/)
Chain-specific adapter implementations and development guides.

### [Security](./security/)
Security specifications, audit reports, and risk mitigation strategies.

### [Integration](./integration/)
Frontend and backend integration guides for developers.

### [APIs](./apis/)
API reference for bridge interactions.

## Supported Blockchains

### Currently Supported
- Base (Primary - Core contracts)
- Ethereum (via Snowbridge)
- Polygon, BSC, Avalanche (via Wormhole)
- Polkadot Parachains (via XCM)

### In Development
- Solana
- Cardano
- Cosmos Hub

### Planned
- Bitcoin
- Algorand, Near, Aptos
- Additional EVM-compatible chains

## Quick Start

### For Users
1. Connect wallet from supported blockchain
2. Browse events on Echain platform
3. Purchase tickets using native tokens
4. Receive NFTs on your preferred chain

### For Developers
1. Review [Architecture](./architecture.md)
2. Choose integration method (frontend SDK or direct API)
3. Implement chain-specific adapter if needed
4. Test on testnet before mainnet deployment

## Development Status

- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: ‚úÖ Core contracts deployed on Base
- **Phase 2 (Expansion)**: üîÑ EVM chain adapters in development
- **Phase 3 (Advanced)**: üìÖ Non-EVM chains planned
