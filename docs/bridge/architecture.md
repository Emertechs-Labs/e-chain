# Custom Bridge Architecture for Echain: Universal Blockchain Interoperability

## Overview

This document outlines Echain's custom bridge architecture designed to enable seamless cross-chain interactions while maintaining all core smart contracts on Base. The bridge provides universal blockchain compatibility through a modular adapter system, allowing easy integration of new blockchains without redeploying contracts.

## Core Philosophy

- **Contract Immutability**: All Echain business logic (events, tickets, POAPs, incentives) remains on Base
- **Modular Adapters**: Chain-specific adapters enable support for any blockchain
- **Message-Based Communication**: Standardized cross-chain messaging protocol
- **Asset Agnostic**: Support for native tokens and wrapped assets across chains

## Architecture Layers

### Layer 1: Core Bridge Protocol (Base)

The central bridge contract handles message routing, validation, and execution.

**Key Components:**
- Message routing and queuing
- Cross-chain asset bridging
- Adapter management
- Security controls (multi-sig, timelocks)

### Layer 2: Chain Adapters (Modular)

Adapters provide blockchain-specific implementations for sending and receiving messages.

**Supported Adapter Types:**
- Polkadot/XCM (native parachains)
- Ethereum/Snowbridge (Ethereum ecosystem)
- Wormhole (multi-chain)
- LayerZero (omnichain messaging)
- Custom adapters (for unsupported chains)

### Layer 3: Frontend Integration

Unified interface for cross-chain operations regardless of underlying blockchain.

## Message Protocol

All cross-chain communication uses a standardized message format:

```typescript
interface CrossChainMessage {
  version: number;
  action: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
  nonce: number;
  userAddress: string;
}
```

**Supported Actions:**
- `PURCHASE_TICKET`: Cross-chain ticket purchase
- `CLAIM_POAP`: Cross-chain POAP minting
- `TRANSFER_NFT`: NFT bridging between chains
- `UPDATE_EVENT`: Event data synchronization

## Chain Integration Process

### 1. Adapter Development

Create a new adapter by extending the `BaseChainAdapter` class:

```typescript
export class NewChainAdapter extends BaseChainAdapter {
  constructor(chainId: number, rpcUrl: string, bridgeContract: string) {
    super(chainId, rpcUrl, bridgeContract);
  }

  async sendMessage(destChainId: number, destContract: string, payload: Uint8Array) {
    // Chain-specific implementation
  }

  protected getChainName(): string { return 'NewChain'; }
  protected supportsAssets(): boolean { return true; }
}
```

### 2. Bridge Registration

Register the adapter with the bridge manager:

```typescript
const bridgeManager = new BridgeManager();
bridgeManager.addChain(NEW_CHAIN_ID, new NewChainAdapter(...));
```

### 3. Message Handling

Implement chain-specific message validation and execution in the adapter.

## Security Model

### Message Validation
- Multi-signature verification
- Oracle-based state proofs
- Time-based validity windows
- Nonce-based replay protection

### Asset Security
- Lock-and-mint mechanism
- Emergency pause functionality
- Insurance coverage for bridge risks
- Regular security audits

## Supported Blockchains

## Technical Specifications

### Bridge Contract Interface

```solidity
interface IEchainBridge {
    function sendMessage(
        uint256 destChainId,
        address destContract,
        bytes calldata payload
    ) external payable;

    function receiveMessage(
        bytes32 messageId,
        uint256 sourceChain,
        address sourceAddress,
        bytes calldata payload
    ) external;

    function estimateFee(
        uint256 destChainId,
        bytes calldata payload
    ) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

### Adapter Interface

```typescript
interface IChainAdapter {
    sendMessage(
        destChainId: number,
        destContract: string,
        payload: Uint8Array,
        messageId: string
    ): Promise<TransactionResult>;

    estimateFee(
        destChainId: number,
        payload: Uint8Array
    ): Promise<bigint>;

    getChainConfig(): ChainConfig;
}
