# Bridge Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures, audit processes, and risk mitigation strategies for Echain's cross-chain bridge system.

## Security Model

### Core Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
2. **Least Privilege**: Components have minimal required permissions
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: System defaults to secure state during failures
4. **Transparent Operations**: All bridge operations are publicly verifiable

### Security Layers

#### 1. Message Layer Security
- **Digital Signatures**: All messages are cryptographically signed
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based prevention of message replay
- **Timelock Validation**: Messages expire after configurable time windows

#### 2. Contract Layer Security
- **Multi-Signature Controls**: Critical operations require multiple approvals
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for administrative functions
- **Circuit Breakers**: Emergency pause functionality for suspicious activity

#### 3. Adapter Layer Security
- **Isolated Execution**: Adapters run in separate processes/containers
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against spam and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all cross-chain inputs

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors

#### 1. Message Manipulation
- **Description**: Attacker attempts to modify or forge cross-chain messages
- **Mitigation**:
  - Cryptographic signatures on all messages
  - Merkle tree verification for message batches
  - Oracle-based message validation

#### 2. Bridge Exploitation
- **Description**: Smart contract vulnerabilities in bridge logic
- **Mitigation**:
  - Formal verification of critical contracts
  - Regular security audits by multiple firms
  - Bug bounty program with significant rewards

#### 3. Oracle Attacks
- **Description**: Compromised or manipulated oracle data
- **Mitigation**:
  - Multiple independent oracles
  - Median-based value aggregation
  - Time-weighted average calculations

#### 4. Governance Attacks
- **Description**: Compromised governance leading to malicious upgrades
- **Mitigation**:
  - Time-locked governance proposals
  - Multi-stage approval process
  - Community oversight and veto rights

#### 5. Economic Attacks
- **Description**: Exploiting economic incentives or liquidity
- **Mitigation**:
  - Economic analysis of bridge mechanisms
  - Liquidity monitoring and alerts
  - Automated rebalancing systems

## Security Audits

### Audit Schedule
- **Pre-Launch**: Comprehensive audit of all bridge contracts
- **Post-Launch**: Quarterly security assessments
- **Major Updates**: Audit before any protocol changes
- **Emergency Patches**: Expedited audit process for critical fixes

### Audit Firms
- **Primary Auditor**: Trail of Bits (comprehensive smart contract audit)
- **Secondary Auditor**: OpenZeppelin (bridge-specific security review)
- **Third-Party Review**: Certik (economic analysis and modeling)

### Audit Scope
- Smart contract logic and implementation
- Bridge protocol security
- Economic attack vectors
- Oracle system integrity
- Governance mechanisms

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks

#### High Impact, High Likelihood
- **Bridge Contract Vulnerabilities**: Mitigated by audits and formal verification
- **Oracle Manipulation**: Mitigated by decentralized oracle networks
- **Governance Compromise**: Mitigated by multi-sig and time-locks

#### High Impact, Low Likelihood
- **51% Attacks on Connected Chains**: Mitigated by multi-chain redundancy
- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Mitigated by bug bounties and monitoring
- **Insider Attacks**: Mitigated by access controls and monitoring

#### Low Impact, High Likelihood
- **Temporary Service Disruptions**: Mitigated by redundant systems
- **Spam Attacks**: Mitigated by rate limiting and fees
- **User Error**: Mitigated by clear documentation and warnings
