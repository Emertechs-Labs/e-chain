## RPC Provider Integration

### Multi-Provider Failover Strategy

Our infrastructure uses three redundant RPC providers with automatic failover:

```typescript
// Priority order:
1. Chainstack (Primary) - Enterprise-grade, high reliability
2. Spectrum Nodes - Decentralized infrastructure  
3. Coinbase Node (Fallback) - Direct Base team support
```

**Implementation:**
- `frontend/lib/web3/rpcConfig.ts` - Client-side failover
- `.github/workflows/deploy-base-mainnet.yml` - Deployment configuration

**Monitoring:**
- Each RPC call logged with provider info
- Automatic switching on timeout/error
- Performance metrics tracked

### Provider Setup Guides

#### Chainstack
1. Sign up: https://chainstack.com/
2. Create project ‚Üí Add network (Base)
3. Get HTTPS endpoint
4. Add to GitHub secrets as `BASE_MAINNET_CHAINSTACK_RPC`

#### Spectrum Nodes
1. Visit: https://spectrumnodes.com/?sPartner=gsd
2. Connect wallet for decentralized access
3. Select Base network
4. Copy RPC URL
5. Add to GitHub secrets as `BASE_MAINNET_SPECTRUM_RPC`

#### Coinbase Developer Platform

3. Enable Base API
4. Get credentials
5. Add to GitHub secrets as `BASE_MAINNET_COINBASE_RPC`

## Farcaster & Base Miniapp Integration

### Current Implementation

**Farcaster Frames:**

## Competing with Luma - Strategic Advantages

### Luma's Weaknesses (Our Opportunities)
1. **Web2 Centralized** - We're decentralized/Web3
2. **No Proof of Attendance** - We issue NFTs
3. **High Fees** - We use blockchain efficiency
4. **Limited Secondary Market** - We have built-in marketplace
5. **No Token Gating** - We enable exclusive events

### Our Differentiators
1. **Blockchain-Native Tickets** - Tamper-proof, transferable
2. **NFT Collectibles** - Memorabilia value
3. **Built on Base** - Low fees (~$0.01 per transaction)
4. **Farcaster Integration** - Native Web3 distribution
5. **DAO-Ready** - Event governance possibilities

### Feature Parity Roadmap
| Feature | Luma | Echain Beta | Echain v1.0 |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|
| Event Creation | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Ticket Sales | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Calendar Sync | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Email Marketing | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

| NFT Tickets | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Secondary Market | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Token Gating | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| On-chain Reputation | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

### Pricing Strategy
**Luma:** 5% + payment processing  
**Echain Beta:** 2.5% + gas fees (~$0.01)  
**Echain Value Prop:** 50% lower fees, NFT ownership

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High Priority
1. **Type safety** - Some `any` types in analytics routes
2. **Error handling** - Improve user-facing error messages
3. **Gas optimization** - Contract deployment costs high
4. **Mobile UX** - Wallet connection can be slow

### Medium Priority  
1. **Caching** - Add Redis for API responses
2. **Image optimization** - CDN for event images
3. **Search** - Implement Algolia/Elasticsearch
4. **Notifications** - Email/push for ticket purchases

### Low Priority
1. **Internationalization** - Currently English only
2. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. **SEO** - Meta tags optimization
4. **Dark mode** - UI theme support
