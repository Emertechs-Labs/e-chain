## üîç RECOMMENDED TESTING BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

### Unit Testing
```bash
cd blockchain
npm test
```

### Coverage Testing
```bash
forge coverage
```

### Gas Analysis
```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

### Slither Static Analysis
```bash
pip install slither-analyzer
slither .
```

### Mythril Security Analysis
```bash
pip install mythril
myth analyze contracts/core/EventFactory.sol
myth analyze contracts/core/EventTicket.sol
```

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Testnet Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to testnet first
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### 2. Verification Steps
- [ ] Verify contract source code on block explorer
- [ ] Test all core functionalities
- [ ] Validate event creation and ticket minting
- [ ] Test emergency pause functionality
- [ ] Verify access control mechanisms

### 3. Security Measures for Production
- [ ] Set up multi-signature wallet for admin functions
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Prepare incident response procedures
- [ ] Set appropriate platform fees and limits

### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# Only after successful testnet validation
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ONGOING MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

### Contract Monitoring
- Monitor large transactions
- Track failed transaction patterns
- Alert on emergency function usage
- Monitor gas price anomalies

### Economic Monitoring
- Track platform fee collection
- Monitor ticket price anomalies
- Validate incentive distribution
- Check for unusual trading patterns

- [ ] Contract addresses documented
- [ ] Verification completed on block explorer
- [ ] Multi-sig configuration verified
- [ ] Admin functions tested
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented
- [ ] Team training completed on incident response

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED
