- **Success confirmations** for completed actions

### Metaphors
- **Familiar concepts** translated to digital experiences
- **Intuitive mappings** between physical and digital worlds
- **Consistent mental models** across applications
- **Natural interactions** that leverage existing knowledge

### User Control
- **User-initiated actions** rather than automatic behaviors
- **Clear exit paths** from any state
- **Reversible operations** where possible
- **Informed consent** for data collection and usage

## Design Patterns

### Navigation
- **Hierarchical navigation** with clear information architecture
- **Tab bars** for primary app sections
- **Back buttons** for returning to previous states
- **Search functionality** prominently placed

### Content Layout
- **Card-based layouts** for organized information
- **Grid systems** for consistent spacing
- **Progressive disclosure** for complex information
- **Scannable content** with clear headings and sections

### Input Methods
- **Touch targets** minimum 44pt for accessibility
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users
- **Voice input** for hands-free operation
- **Drag and drop** for intuitive data manipulation

### Visual Design
- **San-serif typography** (SF Pro) for clarity
- **Limited color palettes** with high contrast ratios
- **Subtle shadows** for depth and hierarchy
- **Consistent iconography** across platforms

## Mobile-Specific Guidelines

### iOS Design Patterns
- **Bottom tab bars** for primary navigation
- **Swipe gestures** for content navigation
- **Pull-to-refresh** for data updates
- **Modal presentations** for secondary tasks

### Touch Interactions
- **Tap for selection** and primary actions
- **Swipe for navigation** and deletion
- **Long press for context menus**
- **Pinch for zoom** and scaling operations

### Screen Sizes
- **Responsive design** across all device sizes
- **Safe areas** for notch and home indicator
- **Dynamic type** for accessibility
- **Dark mode support** for all interfaces

## Web Application Adaptations

### Desktop Web Patterns
- **Hover states** for interactive elements
- **Keyboard navigation** with Tab order
- **Context menus** with right-click
- **Window management** for multi-tasking

### Responsive Design
- **Breakpoint system** for different screen sizes
- **Flexible layouts** that adapt to content
- **Touch-friendly** interactions on all devices
- **Progressive enhancement** for older browsers

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Inclusive Design
- **WCAG compliance** for web standards
- **Color contrast ratios** minimum 4.5:1
- **Screen reader support** for all content
- **Keyboard accessibility** for motor impairments

### Motion and Animation
- **Reduced motion** options for vestibular disorders
- **Meaningful animations** that enhance understanding
- **Consistent timing** for predictable interactions
- **Performance optimization** for smooth experiences

- **Progress indicators** for blockchain operations
- **Error recovery** with actionable guidance

### Token Interfaces
- **Standardized token displays** with icons and symbols
- **Consistent decimal formatting** across platforms
- **Color-coded networks** for multi-chain support
- **Security indicators** for verified contracts

### Decentralized Patterns
- **Self-custody metaphors** using familiar lock/key icons
- **Network status** similar to connectivity indicators
- **Gas fee displays** with clear cost breakdowns
- **Transaction history** with chronological layouts

## Trading Platform Applications

### Chart Interfaces
- **Touch gestures** for chart navigation (pinch-to-zoom)
- **Clear data visualization** with accessible colors
- **Progressive loading** for historical data
- **Real-time updates** with smooth animations

### Order Entry
- **Familiar form patterns** with validation feedback
- **Slider controls** for percentage-based orders
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for rapid trading
- **Confirmation dialogs** for large transactions

### Portfolio Views
- **Hierarchical information** with expandable sections
