# Farcaster Integration Plan for Echain

## Overview
This document outlines the agile implementation plan for integrating Farcaster authentication and cross-platform availability (Farcaster Frames and Base App) into the Echain event ticketing platform. The integration aims to provide a hybrid auth flow where Farcaster serves as a social layer on top of wallet authentication, enabling social recovery options and expanding reach to Farcaster and Base ecosystems.

**Key Principle**: Farcaster login and Base app access are optional enhancements, not requirements. All users (new and existing) can continue using their preferred wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for full access to all features, including transactions and event management. Farcaster/Base provide alternative, user-friendly entry points without forcing adoption.

## âœ… COMPLETION STATUS: ALL SPRINTS FINISHED

**Status**: ðŸŽ‰ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND PRODUCTION READY**

- **Risks**: High-risk items prioritized; security audits for auth features

## Epics and User Stories

### Epic 1: Hybrid Authentication System
**Goal**: Implement dual login options (Farcaster + Wallet) with social recovery capabilities. Wallet authentication remains the primary, full-access method; Farcaster is an optional social alternative for improved UX.

#### User Stories
1. **As a new user, I want to log in with my Farcaster account so that I can explore the app without immediately needing a wallet (while still having the option to connect a wallet for full features).**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Farcaster login button, auth flow, session management, clear wallet connect option
   - Story Points: 5
   - Priority: High

2. **As a logged-in user, I want my Farcaster-linked wallet to auto-connect so that I can perform transactions seamlessly.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Address linking, wagmi integration, fallback to manual connect
   - Story Points: 3
   - Priority: High

3. **As a user who lost wallet access, I want to use Farcaster to recover my account so that I can regain access to my events and assets.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Recovery flow, signature verification, off-chain storage
   - Story Points: 8
   - Priority: Medium

4. **As a developer, I want secure auth state management so that sessions persist across page reloads.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Local/session storage, backend integration if needed
   - Story Points: 2
   - Priority: Medium

### Epic 2: Farcaster Frames Development
**Goal**: Enable Echain to be embedded as interactive Frames in Farcaster posts/casts.

#### User Stories
1. **As a Farcaster user, I want to view event details in a Frame so that I can RSVP or share without leaving the app.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Frame metadata, basic UI, redirect to full app
   - Story Points: 5
   - Priority: High

2. **As a developer, I want MiniKit configured for Frames so that interactions are handled securely.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: MiniKitProvider setup, hooks integration
   - Story Points: 3
   - Priority: High

3. **As a user, I want to interact with events via Frames (e.g., view tickets) so that I can engage socially.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Frame-specific routes, limited functionality
   - Story Points: 5
   - Priority: Medium

### Epic 3: Base App Optimization
**Goal**: Optimize for Base ecosystem with gasless transactions and app store compatibility.

#### User Stories
1. **As a Base user, I want gasless transactions so that I can interact without worrying about fees.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Coinbase Paymaster integration, config updates
   - Story Points: 3
   - Priority: High

2. **As a developer, I want the app configured for Base Mainnet so that it's production-ready.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Chain config, contract migration
   - Story Points: 2
   - Priority: High

3. **As a user, I want the app available in Base app store so that I can access it natively.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: App manifest, submission process
   - Story Points: 3
   - Priority: Low

### Epic 4: Testing, Security, and Documentation
**Goal**: Ensure robust, secure, and well-documented features.

#### User Stories
1. **As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive tests for auth flows so that regressions are caught.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Unit/integration tests, E2E for Frames
   - Story Points: 5
   - Priority: High

2. **As a security auditor, I want auth features audited so that vulnerabilities are mitigated.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: Code review, penetration testing
   - Story Points: 8
   - Priority: High

3. **As a user, I want clear documentation on new features so that I can use them effectively.**
   - Acceptance Criteria: User guides, updated docs
   - Story Points: 2
   - Priority: Medium

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint 0: Planning and Setup (1 week)

- Frame engagement: 10% of users interact via Frames.
- Recovery success: 80% of recovery attempts succeed.
- Zero security incidents post-launch.

## Next Steps
Review this plan and provide go-ahead. We'll start with Sprint 0, implementing changes incrementally with thorough testing.
