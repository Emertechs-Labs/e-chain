# Farcaster Integration Security Audit

## Overview
This document outlines the security assessment for the Farcaster integration in Echain, covering authentication, recovery, Frames, and Base app features.

## Authentication Security

### Farcaster Auth Kit
- **Strengths**:
  - Uses cryptographic signatures for verification
  - No private keys stored client-side
  - Relies on Farcaster's secure custody model
- **Risks**:
  - Centralized dependency on Farcaster infrastructure
  - Potential for Farcaster account compromise affecting access
- **Mitigations**:
  - Always offer wallet fallback
  - Educate users on account security
  - Implement rate limiting on auth attempts

### Hybrid Auth Flow
- **Strengths**:
  - Maintains Web3 security standards
  - Optional social layer doesn't weaken core security
- **Risks**:
  - Social engineering attacks via Farcaster
  - Linkability between social and wallet identities
- **Mitigations**:
  - Clear separation of auth methods
  - User consent for linking
  - Audit logging of auth events

## Recovery Security

### Client-Side Recovery
- **Current Implementation**: Client-side signature verification
- **Risks**:
  - No server-side validation
  - Potential for signature replay attacks
  - Limited to linked addresses only
- **Production Requirements**:
  - Backend validation service
  - Nonce-based signatures to prevent replay
  - Rate limiting and abuse detection
  - Secure storage of recovery metadata

### Social Recovery Model
- **Strengths**:
  - Provides backup access mechanism
  - Cryptographically verifiable
- **Risks**:
  - Single point of failure if Farcaster account lost
  - Social recovery doesn't replace technical backups
- **Mitigations**:
  - Multi-factor recovery options
  - Clear warnings about limitations
  - Encourage wallet seed backups

## Frame Security

### MiniKit Integration
- **Strengths**:
  - Secure iframe communication
  - Isolated execution environment
  - Coinbase's security practices
- **Risks**:
  - Frame injection vulnerabilities
  - Cross-origin issues
- **Mitigations**:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
  - Input validation on Frame responses
  - Regular MiniKit updates

### Frame Interactions
- **Strengths**:
  - Server-side validation via API routes
  - Limited scope interactions
- **Risks**:
  - API endpoint exposure
  - Frame metadata injection
- **Mitigations**:
  - API rate limiting
  - Input sanitization
  - HTTPS enforcement

## Base App Security

### Gasless Transactions
- **Strengths**:
  - Coinbase Paymaster handles gas securely
  - No user funds at risk for gas
- **Risks**:
  - Paymaster service availability
  - Potential for abuse if not monitored
- **Mitigations**:
  - Fallback to user-paid gas
  - Transaction monitoring
  - Paymaster limits and alerts

### PWA Security
- **Strengths**:
  - Standard web security applies
  - Service worker isolation
- **Risks**:
  - Local storage vulnerabilities
  - Manifest injection
- **Mitigations**:
  - Secure storage practices
  - Manifest integrity checks

## General Security Recommendations

### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Code reviews for auth-related changes
- Automated security scanning
- Penetration testing before production

### User Security
- Clear privacy policy updates
- Security best practices documentation
- Incident response plan
- User education on risks

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure API endpoints
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Audit Results
- **Overall Risk Level**: Medium (acceptable for beta features)
- **Critical Issues**: 0
- **High Issues**: 0
- **Medium Issues**: 2 (client-side recovery, centralized auth dependency)
- **Low Issues**: 3 (documentation, monitoring)

## Action Items
1. Implement backend validation for recovery
2. Add comprehensive monitoring
3. Update security documentation
4. Plan penetration testing
5. Establish incident response

## Incident Response Plan

### Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Unauthorized access to user funds, data breach affecting >1000 users
- **High**: Recovery system compromise, Frame injection exploits
- **Medium**: Rate limiting bypass, authentication failures
- **Low**: Minor monitoring alerts, failed login attempts

### Response Procedures

#### For Critical Incidents:
1. **Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)**:
   - Alert security team and executives
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Stop all Farcaster integrations if compromise suspected
   - Notify Coinbase/MiniKit security team

2. **Short-term Actions (15-60 minutes)**:
   - Assess scope of compromise
   - Begin user notification process
   - Implement emergency patches
   - Coordinate with law enforcement if criminal activity suspected

3. **Recovery Actions (1-24 hours)**:
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Deploy security patches
   - Monitor for secondary attacks
   - Complete user notifications

#### For High/Medium Incidents:
1. **Assessment (0-30 minutes)**:
   - Verify incident details
   - Assess potential impact
   - Determine containment strategy

2. **Containment (30-120 minutes)**:
   - Implement temporary fixes
   - Block malicious traffic
   - Update security rules

3. **Recovery (2-8 hours)**:
   - Deploy permanent fixes
   - Restore normal operations
   - Update monitoring rules

### Communication Plan
- **Internal**: Slack security channel, email alerts
- **External**: User notifications via email/app, status page updates
- **Regulatory**: Report to relevant authorities within 72 hours for data breaches

### Post-Incident Activities
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Update security measures
- Review and update incident response plan
- Provide lessons learned report

## User Security Best Practices

### Account Security
- **Enable 2FA**: Always use two-factor authentication on your Farcaster account
- **Secure Recovery**: Keep multiple recovery methods available
- **Regular Monitoring**: Check your account activity regularly
- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, strong passwords for all accounts

### Social Recovery Awareness
- **Understand Limitations**: Social recovery is a convenience feature, not a replacement for wallet backups
- **Verify Links**: Only link addresses you control to your Farcaster account
- **Backup Seed Phrases**: Always backup your wallet seed phrases offline
- **Test Recovery**: Test your recovery process with small amounts first

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Sharing**: Be aware of what data is shared between Farcaster and Echain
- **Address Linking**: Consider privacy implications of linking addresses to social accounts
- **Public Information**: Remember that Farcaster profiles are publicly visible

### Safe Usage Guidelines
- **Official Channels**: Only interact with Echain through official websites and apps
- **Phishing Awareness**: Be cautious of phishing attempts via Farcaster DMs
- **Transaction Verification**: Always verify transaction details before signing
- **Gas Fees**: Understand gas fee implications when using Base network
