# Cardano Interoperability Documentation

## Overview
Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform focused on security, scalability, and sustainability. It uses the UTXO model and is non-EVM compatible, employing Haskell and Plutus for smart contracts. Interoperability is achieved through bridges and sidechains, enabling seamless asset transfers and interactions with other blockchains, including EVM and non-EVM networks. <mcreference link="https://medium.com/wanchain-foundation/update-cardano-cross-chain-bridges-and-other-interoperability-solutions-f8e8b7e2e77" index="3">3</mcreference> <mcreference link="https://adapulse.io/cardano-cross-chain-bridges-the-power-of-interoperability/" index="2">2</mcreference>

## Interoperability Features
- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: Decentralized, non-custodial bridges for bi-directional transfers of ADA, native tokens, and ERC20 tokens between Cardano and EVM-compatible chains.
- **Sidechains**: Solutions like Milkomeda C1 provide EVM compatibility, allowing Solidity developers to build on Cardano.
- **UTXO Model Integration**: Supports unique transaction models for secure cross-chain interactions.
- **Permissionless Bridges**: No authorization needed for usage or node participation in some bridges like Wanchain. <mcreference link="https://adapulse.io/cardano-cross-chain-bridges-the-power-of-interoperability/" index="2">2</mcreference> <mcreference link="https://medium.com/wanchain-foundation/update-cardano-cross-chain-bridges-and-other-interoperability-solutions-f8e8b7e2e77" index="3">3</mcreference> <mcreference link="https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/125mrsz/update_cardano_crosschain_bridges_and_other/" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Supported Bridges and Protocols
- **Wanchain Bridge**: Non-custodial bridge connecting Cardano to EVM and non-EVM chains, supporting ADA and token transfers. Features Bridge-to-Earn incentives.
- **Milkomeda C1**: Sidechain for EVM compatibility, using wrapped ADA for fees and enabling smart contract execution.
- **ChainPort**: Secure bridge with audits, supporting Cardano wallets like Lace and Eternl for token ports.
- **Rosen Bridge**: Connects Cardano with Ergo and other chains, focusing on cross-chain settlement.
- **Others**: Includes solutions like AGIX ERC20 converter for specific token interoperability. <mcreference link="https://adapulse.io/cardano-cross-chain-bridges-the-power-of-interoperability/" index="2">2</mcreference> <mcreference link="https://www.cardanocube.com/categories/cross-chain-bridge" index="4">4</mcreference> <mcreference link="https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/04/28/interoperability-is-key-to-blockchain-growth/" index="5">5</mcreference>

## Integration with Echain
To integrate Cardano with Echain:
- Use Wanchain or ChainPort for asset transfers.
- Implement sidechain solutions for EVM-compatible interactions.
- Develop custom adapters for UTXO-based transactions in Echain's backend.

## Security Considerations
- Use audited bridges like ChainPort to minimize risks.
- Implement non-custodial mechanisms to avoid central points of failure.
- Monitor for bridge exploits and use multi-signature or MPC for added security. <mcreference link="https://adapulse.io/cardano-cross-chain-bridges-the-power-of-interoperability/" index="2">2</mcreference>

## Architectural Notes
Cardano's architecture emphasizes peer-reviewed research and formal methods. Interoperability solutions must align with its UTXO model and Haskell-based contracts. Bridges often involve locking/minting mechanisms across chains.

## Sprint Breakdown
- **Sprint 1**: Research and select bridge (e.g., Wanchain).
- **Sprint 2**: Implement bridge integration in Echain backend.
- **Sprint 3**: Test cross-chain transfers and handle errors.
- **Sprint 4**: Deploy and monitor interoperability features.

## Deployment Guide
1. Set up Cardano node and wallet integration.
2. Configure chosen bridge (e.g., deploy Wanchain nodes if needed).
3. Test on Cardano Pre-Production testnet.
4. Deploy to mainnet with monitoring tools.
5. Provide rollback by maintaining separate environments. <mcreference link="https://medium.com/wanchain-foundation/update-cardano-cross-chain-bridges-and-other-interoperability-solutions-f8e8b7e2e77" index="3">3</mcreference>
