# Quality Assurance & Testing Framework

## Overview

Echain implements a comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) framework focused on ensuring reliability, security, and performance for our Web3 event platform. This document outlines our testing strategy, processes, and standards for beta release and mainnet deployment.

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
```
End-to-End Tests (20%)
Integration Tests (30%)
Unit Tests (50%)
```

### Test Categories

#### 1. Unit Testing
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ code coverage
- **Scope**: Individual functions, components, and smart contracts
- **Tools**: 
  - Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library
  - Smart Contracts: Foundry (Forge)
  - Backend: Jest/Node.js

#### 2. Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Component interactions, API endpoints, contract deployments
- **Tools**: Playwright for E2E, Hardhat for contract integration
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Wallet connections (RainbowKit, Coinbase Wallet)
  - Smart contract interactions (Viem, Wagmi)
  - Multi-chain operations (Base, Polkadot, Cardano)

#### 3. End-to-End Testing
- **Scope**: Complete user journeys from event creation to attendance
- **Tools**: Playwright with custom test harness
- **Critical Paths**:
  - Event creation and NFT ticket minting
  - Ticket purchase and transfer
  - POAP certificate claiming
  - Mini app interactions

#### 4. Performance Testing
- **Metrics**: P99 latency < 1s, 99.9% uptime
- **Tools**: k6 for load testing, Lighthouse for web performance
- **Scenarios**:
  - 10k concurrent users during event launch
  - Smart contract gas optimization
  - RPC node performance (Chainstack/Spectrum)

#### 5. Security Testing
- **Smart Contracts**: Formal verification, audit preparation
- **Frontend**: Input validation, XSS prevention, secure headers
- **Infrastructure**: Penetration testing, dependency scanning
- **Tools**: Slither, Mythril, OWASP ZAP

#### 6. Accessibility Testing
- **Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Tools**: axe-core, Lighthouse accessibility audit
- **Focus**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation

## QA Processes

### Development Workflow
1. **Code Review**: Required for all PRs with QA checklist
2. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline runs full test suite
3. **Security Review**: Smart contract changes require security assessment
4. **Performance Validation**: Performance benchmarks must be met
5. **Accessibility Check**: UI changes verified for accessibility compliance

### Sprint QA Activities
- **Daily**: Automated test runs on feature branches
- **Sprint Review**: Demo with QA validation
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Test coverage and quality metrics review
- **Release**: Full regression testing and performance validation

### Beta Testing Program
- **Target Users**: 1000+ beta participants
- **Duration**: 4-week beta period
- **Focus Areas**:
  - User experience validation
  - Performance under load
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Mobile responsiveness
  - Wallet integration reliability

## Test Environments

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Daily development and unit testing
- **Infrastructure**: Local development with hot reload
- **Data**: Mock data and local blockchain (Anvil)

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and QA validation
- **Infrastructure**: Base testnet deployment
- **Data**: Test data with realistic scenarios

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Beta testing and mainnet preparation
- **Infrastructure**: Base mainnet with monitoring
- **Data**: Real user data with privacy controls
