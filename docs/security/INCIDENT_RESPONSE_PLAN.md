**Owner**: Security Team

## 🚨 Overview

This document outlines procedures for responding to security incidents in the Echain platform.

## 📋 Incident Classification

### Critical (P0)
- Private key compromise
- Smart contract vulnerability exploitation
- Database breach
- Mass user data exposure
- Complete service outage

**Response Time**: Immediate (< 15 minutes)  
**Escalation**: Page on-call engineer + notify CEO

### High (P1)
- Individual user wallet compromise
- Payment processing failure
- Contract function exploit attempt
- DDoS attack
- Unauthorized admin access

**Response Time**: < 1 hour  
**Escalation**: Notify security team + engineering lead

### Medium (P2)
- Suspicious transaction patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- API rate limit violations
- Phishing attempts
- Minor data leaks

**Response Time**: < 4 hours  
**Escalation**: Security team review

### Low (P3)
- Security scan alerts
- Outdated dependencies
- Configuration issues
- Non-sensitive information disclosure

**Response Time**: < 24 hours

## 🔐 Incident Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage (0-15 min)

**Actions**:
1. Confirm incident is real (not false positive)
2. Classify severity level
3. Document initial findings
4. Alert appropriate team members
5. Create incident ticket

**Tools**:
- Sentry alerts
- Monitoring dashboards
- Blockchain explorers
- Log aggregation

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Incident confirmed
- [ ] Severity assigned
- [ ] Incident ticket created (#INC-)
- [ ] Initial team notified
- [ ] War room established (if P0/P1)

---

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 min)

**Immediate Actions**:

**For Smart Contract Issues**:
```solidity
// Emergency pause
await eventFactory.pause();  // Pausable contracts
await eventTicket.pause();
await poapAttendance.pause();
```

**For API/Backend Issues**:
```bash
# Rate limit specific IPs
vercel env add RATE_LIMIT_IPS "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8"

# Disable specific features
vercel env add FEATURE_FLAGS '{"marketplace":false}'

# Enable maintenance mode
vercel env add MAINTENANCE_MODE true
```

**For Database/Storage Issues**:
```bash
# Revoke compromised credentials
# Rotate all API keys
npm run rotate-keys

# Backup current state
npm run emergency-backup
```

**Containment Checklist**:
- [ ] Attack vector identified
- [ ] Further damage prevented
- [ ] Affected systems isolated
- [ ] Evidence preserved
- [ ] Backup created

---

### Phase 3: Investigation (1-4 hours)

**Investigation Steps**:

1. **Collect Evidence**
   - Transaction hashes
   - Log files
   - User reports
   - Sentry error traces
   - Blockchain explorer data

2. **Analyze Attack Pattern**
   - Entry point
   - Exploitation method
   - Affected users/contracts
   - Financial impact
   - Data accessed

3. **Determine Root Cause**
   - Code vulnerability
   - Configuration error
   - Social engineering
   - Third-party compromise

**Investigation Tools**:
```bash
# Check recent transactions
cast logs --address $CONTRACT_ADDRESS --from-block $START_BLOCK

# Analyze contract state
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getState()"

# Review API logs
vercel logs --since 1h

# Check Sentry errors
open https://sentry.io/organizations/echain/issues/
```

---

### Phase 4: Eradication (2-8 hours)

**Remediation Actions**:

**Code Fixes**:
```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/security-incident-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Apply fix
# ... make changes ...

# Emergency deployment
npm run deploy:emergency
```

**Contract Upgrades** (if using UUPS):
```solidity
// Deploy new implementation
const newImplementation = await ethers.getContractFactory("EventFactoryV2");
const deployed = await newImplementation.deploy();

// Upgrade proxy
await eventFactory.upgradeTo(deployed.address);
```

**Configuration Changes**:
```bash
# Update environment variables
vercel env add SECURITY_PATCH_LEVEL "2025-10-26"

# Deploy configuration
vercel --prod
```

**Eradication Checklist**:
- [ ] Vulnerability patched
- [ ] Malicious access removed
- [ ] Compromised credentials rotated
- [ ] Security controls strengthened
- [ ] Changes deployed to production

---

### Phase 5: Recovery (4-24 hours)

**Recovery Steps**:

1. **Resume Services**
   ```bash
   # Unpause contracts
   await eventFactory.unpause();
   
   # Disable maintenance mode
   vercel env rm MAINTENANCE_MODE
   
   # Re-enable features
   vercel env add FEATURE_FLAGS '{}'
   ```

2. **Verify System Integrity**
   ```bash
   # Run health checks
   curl https://echain-eight.vercel.app/api/health
   
   # Verify contract state
   npm run verify:contracts
   
   # Test critical paths
   npm run test:e2e:critical
   ```

3. **Monitor for Recurrence**
   - Enhanced monitoring for 48 hours
   - Alert thresholds tightened
   - Manual review of suspicious activity

**Recovery Checklist**:
- [ ] Services restored
- [ ] System integrity verified
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring active
- [ ] No anomalies detected
- [ ] User communication sent

---

### Phase 6: Post-Incident (24-72 hours)

**Post-Mortem Activities**:

1. **Write Incident Report**
   - Timeline of events
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Lessons learned
   - Action items

2. **Communicate to Users**
   ```markdown
   Subject: Security Incident Update
