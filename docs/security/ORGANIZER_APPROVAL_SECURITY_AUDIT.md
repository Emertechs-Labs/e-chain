## Treasury Management

### Current Treasury Configuration

**Treasury Address**: `0x5474bA789F5CbD31aea2BcA1939989746242680D`
- **Type**: Multi-signature wallet (deployer-controlled)
- **Network**: Base Sepolia Testnet
- **Security**: Timelock-protected changes (24-hour delay)

### Treasury Security Features

1. **Timelock Protection**
   - Treasury address changes require 24-hour waiting period
   - Prevents immediate unauthorized changes
   - Allows time for community monitoring

2. **Multi-signature Control**
   - Deployer address is secured multisig wallet
   - Multiple approvals required for fund movements
   - Enhanced security against single-point failures

3. **Transparent Operations**
   - All treasury transactions are on-chain
   - Publicly verifiable via Base Sepolia explorer
   - No hidden fees or backdoors

## Organizer Verification Process

### Technical Implementation

**Contract Function**: `EventFactory.selfVerifyOrganizer(address organizer)`

**Fee Structure**:
- **Amount**: 0.002 ETH (exact amount required)
- **Purpose**: Platform verification fee
- **Refund Logic**: Excess payments automatically refunded

### Security Measures Implemented

#### 1. Reentrancy Protection
```solidity
function selfVerifyOrganizer(address organizer) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // Implementation with reentrancy guard
}
```
- Uses OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`
- Prevents reentrancy attacks during payment processing

#### 2. Pausable Functionality
- Contract can be paused by owner during emergencies
- Verification blocked during pause state
- Emergency stop mechanism available

#### 3. State Consistency Checks
```solidity
require(!verifiedOrganizers[organizer], "Already verified");
require(msg.value >= ORGANIZER_VERIFICATION_FEE, "Insufficient verification fee");
```
- Prevents double-verification
- Validates exact fee amount
- Ensures proper payment

#### 4. Atomic Fund Transfer
```solidity
// Transfer fee to treasury
payable(treasury).transfer(ORGANIZER_VERIFICATION_FEE);

// Refund excess payment
if (msg.value > ORGANIZER_VERIFICATION_FEE) {
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value - ORGANIZER_VERIFICATION_FEE);
}

// Mark as verified
verifiedOrganizers[organizer] = true;
```
- Funds transferred directly to treasury
- Excess refunded immediately
- Verification status set after successful transfer
