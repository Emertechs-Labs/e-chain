# Product-Market Fit Assessment (Events on Base)

Goal: validate problem–solution fit and accelerate toward PMF.

Target users:
- Event organizers (web3-native and traditional), communities, creators

Jobs-to-be-done:
- Sell verifiable tickets, prevent fraud, reward attendance, grow communities

Signals to track:
- Organizer retention (M2), repeat event creation rate
- Ticket sell-through %, secondary market volume
- NPS from organizers and attendees
- Onchain usage: unique wallets, tx success rate, gas per ticket

Experiments:
- Mini app distribution via Farcaster; measure conversion to ticket purchase
- Pricing A/B (creator royalties, fees)
- Referral incentives vs loyalty points redemption

Benchmarks & references:
- Base ecosystem distribution: https://docs.base.org
- Luma (competitor) site: https://luma.com/

Decision gates:
- PMF proxy when ≥ 40% of organizers say they’d be "very disappointed" if removed
- Growth channel with CAC<LTV identified
