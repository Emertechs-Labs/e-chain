```
Attendees: Entire team
Goal: Select sprint backlog items

Agenda:
1. Review sprint goal (15min)
2. Review product backlog (30min)
3. Team capacity planning (15min)
4. Story selection & commitment (60min)

Output:
‚úÖ Sprint goal defined
‚úÖ Sprint backlog committed
‚úÖ Stories estimated
```

**Part 2: How will we do the work? (2h)**
```

#### 2. Daily Stand-up (15 minutes)

**Format**:
```
Each team member answers:
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. What blockers do I have?

Rules:
- Time-boxed to 15 minutes
- Stand-up (literally)
- No problem-solving (take offline)
- Update Jira/Linear board
```

**Example**:
```
Alice (Frontend):
- Yesterday: Completed event creation form
- Today: Implement ticket purchase flow
- Blockers: Waiting for contract ABI from Bob

Bob (Smart Contracts):
- Yesterday: Deployed contracts to testnet
- Today: Write integration tests
- Blockers: None
```

#### 3. Backlog Refinement (1 hour, mid-sprint)

**Purpose**: Prepare for next sprint

```
Agenda:
1. Review new items (20min)
2. Estimate upcoming stories (30min)
3. Clarify acceptance criteria (10min)

Output:
‚úÖ Next sprint items estimated
‚úÖ Acceptance criteria clear
‚úÖ ~2 sprints worth of ready stories
```

#### 4. Sprint Review (2 hours)

**Format**: Demo + Feedback

```
Agenda:
1. Sprint recap (10min)
2. Demo completed stories (60min)
3. Stakeholder feedback (40min)
4. Update roadmap (10min)

Attendees:
- Development team
- Product owner
- Stakeholders
- Beta users (optional)

Output:
‚úÖ Working software demoed
‚úÖ Feedback collected
‚úÖ Backlog updated
```

#### 5. Sprint Retrospective (1.5 hours)

**Format**: Team reflection

```
Framework: Start-Stop-Continue

What should we START doing?
‚îú‚îÄ New practices
‚îú‚îÄ Tools to adopt
‚îî‚îÄ Experiments to try

What should we STOP doing?
‚îú‚îÄ Inefficient processes
‚îú‚îÄ Time wasters
‚îî‚îÄ Blockers to remove

What should we CONTINUE doing?
‚îú‚îÄ What's working well
‚îú‚îÄ Successful patterns
‚îî‚îÄ Team strengths

Output:
‚úÖ 2-3 action items for next sprint
‚úÖ Process improvements identified
‚úÖ Team morale assessed
```

## üìä Story Points & Estimation

### Fibonacci Scale

```
Story Points: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

1 point = ~2-4 hours (trivial)
2 points = ~4-8 hours (simple)
3 points = ~1 day (medium)
5 points = ~2-3 days (complex)
8 points = ~1 week (very complex)
13 points = ~2 weeks (epic - split it!)
21+ points = Too large (break down)
```

### Estimation Technique: Planning Poker

**Process**:
```
1. Product Owner reads user story
2. Team asks clarifying questions
3. Each member selects a card (1-21)
4. All reveal simultaneously
5. Discuss differences
6. Re-estimate until consensus

If estimates vary widely (>3 points):
‚îî‚îÄ Discuss assumptions
‚îî‚îÄ Clarify requirements
‚îî‚îÄ Re-estimate
```

### Reference Stories (Baseline)
