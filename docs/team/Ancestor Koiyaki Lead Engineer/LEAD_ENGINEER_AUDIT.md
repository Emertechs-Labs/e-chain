# Lead Engineering Audit Summary â€” Ancestor

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Reviewer:** Cascade (AI)  
**Scope:** Cross-team audit findings (smart contracts, full-stack, UI/UX), QA operations, documentation alignment

## Platform Posture Snapshot
- **Smart Contracts:** Medium-risk treasury control and payout patterns remain open despite CREATE2 deployment win; requires governance follow-up.@docs/team/Peter Smart Contract Dev/AUDIT_SUMMARY.md#1-43
- **Application Stack:** Frontend leans on direct RPC scanning with limited automation coverage, stressing need for API/cache investments and CI-grade tests.@docs/team/Daniel Full Stack Dev/FULL_STACK_AUDIT.md#1-42
- **Experience Layer:** Hero/animation polish is high, but motion accessibility and CTA hierarchy gaps risk UX regressions on mobile or reduced-motion contexts.@docs/team/Natasha Frontend UI-UX/UX_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md#1-39
- **QA Operations:** Repeated QA runs surface potential secrets and Solidity formatting noise; leadership should enforce remediation and tooling consistency.@docs/qalog.md#1-142

## Immediate Priorities
1. **Security & Treasury Governance**  
   Finalize removal/restriction plan for `setTreasury`, enforce timelock workflows, and schedule regression tests before next deployment window.@docs/team/Peter Smart Contract Dev/BACKLOG.md#1-9

2. **Data Access Strategy**  
   Sponsor API/cache layer initiative so event pagination, metadata enrichment, and observability stop depending on expensive RPC loops.@docs/team/Daniel Full Stack Dev/BACKLOG.md#1-9

3. **Accessibility Compliance**  
   Charter cross-functional effort to implement `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks and clarify hero CTA hierarchy so design intent matches shipped UX.@docs/team/Natasha Frontend UI-UX/BACKLOG.md#1-9

4. **QA Signal-to-Noise Cleanup**  
   Resolve secret-scan false positives or actual exposures highlighted in QA logs and ensure Solidity formatter/linter output is stable before next audit.@docs/qalog.md#35-158

## Leadership Actions & Sequencing
1. **Set Up Cross-Team War Room**  
   - Participants: Peter, Daniel, Natasha, DevOps.  
   - Agenda: Treasury governance plan, API/cache rollout, motion accessibility timeline.  
   - Deliverable: Shared remediation schedule tracked in team backlogs.

2. **Documentation Alignment Push**  
   - Update top-level docs (README/AUDIT_SUMMARY/security) with latest findings to avoid drift.  
   - Introduce CHANGELOG + TEAM_OVERVIEW for quick leadership visibility (see docs roadmap recommendations).

3. **QA Policy Review**  
   - Investigate recurrent "Potential exposed secrets" events (true positives vs tooling).  
   - Define criteria for passing QA gate to prevent noisy regressions from slipping.

4. **Observability & Reporting**  
   - Require metrics from Base RPC manager and wallet flows so incidents surface before user impact.  
   - Tie dashboards into leadership weekly reports.

## Risks Requiring Monitoring
- **Governance Debt:** Without locking treasury updates, a single compromised key undermines otherwise strong contract security posture.
- **Operational Load:** Direct blockchain reads continue scaling poorly; without near-term API migration, upcoming growth efforts will stall. 
- **Compliance Exposure:** Accessibility gaps could threaten enterprise deals; acting now maintains design credibility.
- **QA Fatigue:** Persistent false alarms may desensitize engineers; leadership needs decisive resolution.

## Decision Requests for Ancestor
1. Approve resourcing (or external vendor) for treasury governance audit and fix implementation.
2. Greenlight API layer project (team assignment, timeline, budget) to reduce RPC dependency.
3. Confirm accessibility deliverables belong in the next design sprint and assign ownership.
4. Mandate QA tooling review with concrete deadline to handle secret-scan outputs.
