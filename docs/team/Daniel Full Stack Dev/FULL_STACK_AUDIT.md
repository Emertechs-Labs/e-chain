## Urgent Audit Findings & Next Steps

### Critical Frontend Build Blocker

**Issue:** The frontend build is currently failing due to persistent "Module not found" errors related to Firebase dependencies within the `@polymathuniversata/echain-wallet` package. This issue has resisted common Next.js configuration fixes (transpilation, Webpack aliases, module resolution adjustments).

**Impact:** This is a complete blocker for frontend development, testing, and deployment, preventing the achievement of a "fully functional beta."

**Action Required:** Immediate and focused investigation into the `@polymathuniversata/echain-wallet` package's bundling of Firebase dependencies, or a more specialized Next.js/Webpack debugging approach is required to resolve this critical issue.

### Reiteration: Dedicated API Layer

**Recommendation:** As previously highlighted, standing up a dedicated API layer (e.g., Edge functions or a Node.js service) remains a high-priority recommendation. This layer should aggregate event/ticket data, apply access control, and expose cached responses to the frontend.

**Rationale:** Direct RPC integration, while functional, introduces performance bottlenecks, scalability challenges, and security concerns that are not suitable for a robust beta or production environment.

**Action Required:** Prioritize the design and implementation of this API layer to support the upcoming beta and future production releases.
