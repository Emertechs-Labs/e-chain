# Team Directory Structure Standard

## Overview
This document defines the standard structure for team member directories within the Echain project.

## Directory Naming Convention
- Format: `FirstName LastName - Role`
- Example: `John Smith - Backend Developer`

## Required Files
Each team member directory must contain the following files:

1. **PROFILE.md** - Team member profile, skills, and responsibilities
2. **TASKS.md** - Current and upcoming tasks
3. **BACKLOG.md** - Backlog items assigned to this team member
4. **LOG.md** - Work log and progress updates
5. **ISSUES.md** - Issues encountered and their resolutions
6. **ROLE_AUDIT.md** - Role-specific audit file (naming based on role)

## Role-Specific Audit Files
- Lead Engineer: `LEAD_ENGINEER_AUDIT.md`
- Frontend Developer: `FRONTEND_AUDIT.md`
- Backend Developer: `BACKEND_AUDIT.md`
- Full Stack Developer: `FULL_STACK_AUDIT.md`
- Smart Contract Developer: `SMART_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md`
- UI/UX Designer: `UX_AUDIT.md`
- DevOps Engineer: `DEVOPS_AUDIT.md`
- QA Engineer: `QA_AUDIT.md`
