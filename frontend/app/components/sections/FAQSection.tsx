              answer: "NFT tickets are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain. Each ticket contains event details, seat information, and ownership verification. They're transferable, verifiable, and cannot be duplicated or counterfeited."

              question: "Are my tickets secure?",
              answer: "Absolutely. All tickets are minted as NFTs on the blockchain, making them immutable and tamper-proof. You maintain full ownership and can transfer them securely to anyone."

              question: "What are POAP rewards?",
